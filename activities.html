<h1>Activities</h1>
  <h2>Sakura Festival</h2>

  <br>

<p>
Cherry Blossom Festival, also known as Hanami or Sakura season, is a favorite to both locals and tourists! Cherry blossoms normally bloom in late March to mid-April or even in early May. Admiring these flowers is a tradition that goes back over a thousand years. Although, the first official festival began in 1935 and became an annual event in Japan.
</p>

<p>
Cherry blossoms are a symbolic flower of springtime, renewal, and the fleeting nature of life, as the life span of these flowers, is rather short. Celebrations may occur during the day or nighttime (the nighttime version is called yozakura) and are usually preferred as lights are strung up and the scenery is even more colorful.
</p>
<p>
There are a variety of locations to enjoy Hanami such as Ueno Park, Meguro River, and Takada Castle. At Ueno Park, families and friends picnic usually with homemade foods and drinks. You can also enjoy local crafts and food, trips on the boating lake, and enjoy music and colorful dance performances. At this park, there is also the famous "Last Samurai" statue of Saigo Takamori.
