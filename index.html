<h1>Tokyo</h1>
<h2> The World's Largest Metropolis!</h2>
</div>
</div>

  <p>
    The city that you now know as Tokyo first started out as a small fishing village named Edo around 3,000 B.C
  </p>

  <p>
    The influence of this small village in Japanese society was from its role as the base of power for the Tokugawa shogunate. During the Edo period, the small village grew into a large city and encountered economic and cultural growth.
  </p>

  <p>
      By 1720, there were over 1.1 million people, making it one of the largest cities in the world. After a 700-year rule, the shogunate period had come to an end when the new Emperor named Meiji came into rule and the city's name was formally changed to Tokyo in 1868, meaning eastern capital.
